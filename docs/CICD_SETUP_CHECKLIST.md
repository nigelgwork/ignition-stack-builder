# CI/CD Setup Checklist

Quick checklist for setting up automated deployment to `ignitionvps.gaskony.me`.

## On Your VPS Server

### 1. Run Production Setup Script
```bash
ssh your_user@ignitionvps.gaskony.me

# Download and run setup script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nigelgwork/ignition-stack-builder/main/scripts/production-setup.sh
chmod +x production-setup.sh
./production-setup.sh
```

- [ ] Docker installed
- [ ] Repository cloned to `~/ignition-stack-builder`
- [ ] `.env` files created and passwords changed
- [ ] SSL certificates generated
- [ ] Services started successfully
- [ ] Database migrations completed

### 2. Generate SSH Key for GitHub Actions
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions" -f ~/.ssh/github_actions_deploy_key
cat ~/.ssh/github_actions_deploy_key.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

- [ ] SSH key generated
- [ ] Public key added to authorized_keys
- [ ] Private key copied (for GitHub Secrets)

### 3. Get Server Details
```bash
echo "Host: $(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')"
echo "User: $(whoami)"
cat ~/.ssh/github_actions_deploy_key
```

- [ ] Production host identified
- [ ] Production user identified
- [ ] Private SSH key saved

## On GitHub

### 4. Add Repository Secrets

Go to: **Settings** â†’ **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions** â†’ **New repository secret**

Add these secrets:

- [ ] `PRODUCTION_HOST` = `ignitionvps.gaskony.me` (or your server IP)
- [ ] `PRODUCTION_USER` = your SSH username
- [ ] `PRODUCTION_SSH_KEY` = entire private key (including BEGIN/END lines)
- [ ] `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` = your Docker Hub username
- [ ] `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` = Docker Hub access token (create at https://hub.docker.com/settings/security)

Optional (for enhanced security):
- [ ] `JWT_SECRET_KEY` = random 32+ character string
- [ ] `SESSION_SECRET` = random 32+ character string

### 5. Configure Production Environment

Go to: **Settings** â†’ **Environments** â†’ **New environment**

- [ ] Environment name: `production`
- [ ] Environment URL: `https://ignitionvps.gaskony.me`
- [ ] (Optional) Add required reviewers for approval before deployment
- [ ] (Optional) Restrict to `main` branch only

### 6. Test the Pipeline

```bash
# In your local dev environment
cd /git/ignition-stack-builder

# Make a test change
echo "<!-- CI/CD Test -->" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```

Then watch the deployment:
- [ ] Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
- [ ] Watch workflow: CI Tests â†’ Build Images â†’ Deploy to Production
- [ ] Verify deployment at https://ignitionvps.gaskony.me

## Verification

### 7. Verify Deployment

Check that everything is working:

```bash
# Check services on server
ssh your_user@ignitionvps.gaskony.me
cd ~/ignition-stack-builder
docker compose ps
```

Expected output:
```
NAME                     STATUS
stack-builder-auth-db    Up (healthy)
stack-builder-backend    Up
stack-builder-frontend   Up
stack-builder-redis      Up (healthy)
```

Check the website:
- [ ] Frontend accessible at https://ignitionvps.gaskony.me
- [ ] Can create user account
- [ ] Can login successfully
- [ ] Can select services and generate stack

### 8. Check GitHub Actions Status

- [ ] CI workflow passing (green checkmark)
- [ ] Deploy workflow completed successfully
- [ ] No errors in Action logs

## Troubleshooting

### SSH Connection Fails
```bash
# Test SSH key locally
ssh -i ~/.ssh/github_actions_deploy_key your_user@ignitionvps.gaskony.me "echo 'Success'"
```

If this fails:
- [ ] Check public key is in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on server
- [ ] Verify private key in GitHub Secrets has no extra spaces/newlines
- [ ] Check server firewall allows SSH (port 22)

### Deployment Fails
- [ ] Check GitHub Actions logs for specific error
- [ ] Verify all secrets are set correctly in GitHub
- [ ] Check server has enough disk space: `df -h`
- [ ] Verify Docker is running: `docker ps`

### Services Won't Start
```bash
ssh your_user@ignitionvps.gaskony.me
cd ~/ignition-stack-builder

# Check logs
docker compose logs backend
docker compose logs frontend

# Restart services
docker compose restart

# Full rebuild
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Success! ðŸŽ‰

Your CI/CD pipeline is now active. Every push to `main` will automatically deploy to production!

**What happens on every push:**
1. âœ… Tests run automatically
2. âœ… Docker images built and pushed
3. âœ… Database backup created
4. âœ… Code deployed to production
5. âœ… Health checks verify deployment
6. âœ… Old images/backups cleaned up

**Next steps:**
- Set up monitoring/alerting
- Configure Let's Encrypt for SSL
- Set up staging environment (optional)
- Add notification webhooks (Slack/Discord)
