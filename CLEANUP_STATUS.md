**Reason**: Working directory issues prevent bash execution

## ‚úÖ What You Need To Do

### Option 1: Quick Copy-Paste (Recommended)

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
cd /git/ignition-stack-builder
./cleanup_for_github.sh
```

If that doesn't work, use the manual commands in `MANUAL_CLEANUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### Option 2: Use Python Script

```bash
cd /git/ignition-stack-builder
python3 do_cleanup.py
```

### Option 3: Manual Commands

See `MANUAL_CLEANUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for complete step-by-step instructions.
