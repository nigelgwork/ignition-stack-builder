---

### Test Runner Features

**Automated steps**:
1. Generate stack from API (`/download` endpoint)
2. Extract ZIP file
3. Deploy using start.sh or docker-compose
4. Wait for services (configurable time)
5. Check container status
6. Run health checks
7. Record results
8. Calculate duration

**Output**:
- Color-coded console output
- Result files in `results/`
- Container status capture
- Health check logs

---

### Issues Encountered & Resolved

**Issue #1**: `unzip: command not found`
- **Solution**: Installed with `apt-get install -y unzip`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

**Issue #2**: Stack builder containers not running
- **Cause**: Containers had been stopped/cleaned up
- **Solution**: Restarted with `docker-compose up -d`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

**Issue #3**: API not accessible at localhost:8000
- **Cause**: Port not exposed or containers in wrong network
- **Solution**: Ensured containers running in correct docker-compose context
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Session Notes

**Time Management**:
- Infrastructure setup: ~45 min
- Troubleshooting: ~30 min
- Test case creation: ~15 min
- Actual testing: In progress

**Lessons Learned**:
1. Ensure stack builder containers are running before tests
2. Install system dependencies (unzip) first
3. Test runner works well, good progress indicators
4. Health check utility ready for service-specific checks

**Token Usage**: ~120k/200k (60% used)

### Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Resume testing
cd /git/ignition-stack-builder/tests

# Check if T001 completed
cat results/T001_*.txt

# Run next tests
./test_runner.sh test_cases/T002_ignition_only.json 90
./test_runner.sh test_cases/T003_grafana_only.json 30

# View cumulative results
cat TEST_RESULTS.md
```

---

**Session Status**: ✅ Infrastructure Complete, Testing In Progress
**Blockers**: None
**Ready for**: Test Execution (Next Session)

---

## Session 2: 2025-10-07 (Continued)

**Duration**: ~120 minutes
**Status**: Critical bug found and fixed, testing resumed
**Completed**: Named volume fix implemented and verified
**Next**: Continue systematic testing

---

### Critical Bug Discovery and Resolution

**Issue Found**: Bind mount volumes fail on WSL2/Docker Desktop
- Error: "unable to start container process: error mounting... no such file or directory"
- Impact: 100% of generated stacks fail to start on WSL2
- Root cause: Docker overlay filesystem incompatible with bind mounts

**Fix Implemented**:
1. Updated `backend/catalog.json` - converted all 25 services to named volumes
2. Updated `backend/main.py` - added named volume collection and generation
3. Simplified Ignition initialization (no longer needs two-phase startup)

**Verification**:
- ✅ PostgreSQL container starts successfully
- ✅ Named volumes created automatically
- ✅ Database accepts connections
- ✅ Data persists across restarts
- ✅ T001 test passes completely

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/catalog.json` (all service volume definitions)
- `backend/main.py` (lines 612-628, 720-741, 1068-1190)
- `CRITICAL_BUG_FOUND.md` (updated with resolution)

---

### Testing Infrastructure Issue

**Issue**: Stack builder containers stop after system operations

**Root Cause**:
- User ran `/upgrade` command which likely restarted Docker daemon
- Containers with `restart: unless-stopped` don't auto-start after explicit stops or daemon restarts
- This causes "Connection refused" errors when trying to run tests

**Solution Created**:
1. Created `tests/ensure_stack_running.sh` - helper script to check and start stack builder
2. Created `tests/TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - comprehensive testing guide
3. Added troubleshooting decision tree and common issues

**Key Learning**: Always verify stack builder is running before testing

**New Testing Protocol**:
```bash
cd /git/ignition-stack-builder/tests
./ensure_stack_running.sh  # Run before EVERY test session
```

---

### Test Results (Session 2)

#### T001: PostgreSQL Only ✅ PASS
- Stack generated successfully
- Named volume syntax confirmed: `postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`
- Container started without errors
- Database healthy: `pg_isready` returns "accepting connections"
- Data persistence verified across restart
- **Duration**: ~2 minutes
- **Status**: ✅ PASS

#### T002: Ignition Only (In Progress)
- Stack generated successfully
- Named volume syntax confirmed: `ignition-data:/usr/local/bin/ignition/data`
- Ready to deploy and test
- **Status**: ⏸️ Pending deployment

---

### Session Notes

**Time Management**:
- Bug discovery and documentation: ~30 min
- Fix implementation: ~30 min
- Testing and verification: ~20 min
- Infrastructure improvements: ~15 min
- Actual testing: ~5 min (T001 only)

**Lessons Learned**:
1. Systematic testing catches critical bugs before production
2. Named volumes are more reliable than bind mounts on WSL2
3. Stack builder can stop due to system operations - need helper script
4. Documentation as you go prevents repeated issues

**Token Usage**: ~89k/200k (44% used)

---

### Next Session Tasks

1. ✅ Verify stack builder is running (`./ensure_stack_running.sh`)
2. Complete T002 (Ignition only) deployment and testing
3. Execute T003 (Grafana only)
4. Execute T101 (Ignition + PostgreSQL)
5. Continue with remaining Category 1 tests
6. Update TEST_RESULTS.md with comprehensive results

---

**Session Status**: 🔧 Critical Fix Implemented, Testing Resumed
**Blockers**: None
**Ready for**: Systematic Testing (T002 onwards)
